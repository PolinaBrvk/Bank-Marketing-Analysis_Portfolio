# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis


This is the project for a Data Analyst position. In this assignment, I worked with a real-world Portuguese bank telemarketing campaign dataset to analyze customer behaviour and how campaign factors influence clients to subcsribe. In this analysis, I will determine which age, job, and education groups are most likely to subscribe to the bank campaign. Additionally, will identify the time of year that is most successful for marketing advertisements and examine how education and job occupation are correlated with subscription to the bank’s campaign. The goal is to provide insights that can help optimize future campaigns and improve targeting strategies.

## The Key questions to answer:
- What is the success rate of the marketing campaign? 
- Which customer groups (like age, job, education) are more likely to subscribe? 
- How do campaign call duration, date of the call affect subscription rates? 
- Is there a correlation between job, education, and age that affects the decision to subscribe?
- What are the recommendations for improving the strategy and attracting more clients?

## Summary of Insights

- **Excel** – data cleaning, pivot tables, initial exploration for further analysis. 
- **SQL** – querying, aggregation, campaign analysis.
- **Tableau** – dashboards, segmentation analysis, visual storytelling 

The success rate of this marketing campaign is approximately 12% which means that approximately 1 in 9 customers who were contacted chose to subscribe to a term deposit campaign. It showed a good performance, considering that typical rates for financial marketing campaigns often are below 10%.  

After analysing the age group subscription, the 61+ age group had the highest subscription rate (42%), this information indicates that older people may be more financially cautious and interested in securing deposits. Students and retirees as job groups had conversion 29% and 23% of sucess rate, possibly meaning that they have financial priorities or available time to consider such advertisments. I have noticed that, students subscribe more often, likely due to targeted offers or support (for example, loan for university), while the “Under 25” group includes non-students with lower subscription rates.

The correlation between Job and Education reveals which combinations are most likely to subscribe to the campaign, showing both the size of each group and their relative success, helping identify high-potential target segments.

Regarding the calls and their duration, longer conversations (10+ minutes) have a higher success rate than shorter calls. The months of March and December showed 52% and 47% conversion rates, while May and July had the lowest conversion, which may be due to the summer and holiday periods affecting clients’ responsiveness and willingness to engage with the campaign.
